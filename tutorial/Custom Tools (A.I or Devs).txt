üìÑ H7T Tool Creation Instructions (for AI or Developers)

Purpose:
--------
H7T automatically detects Python files (*.py) in the tools/ folder
that contain a main() function. Each tool is run via terminal selection.

‚úÖ Required Structure:
----------------------

Each tool must follow this exact template:

    # tools/your_tool_name.py

    def main():
        # Your tool logic here
        print("This is my tool's output")
        # You can use input(), print(), etc.

    # Do NOT call main() here. H7T does that automatically.

‚ö†Ô∏è Rules to Follow:
-------------------

- Place the file inside the `tools/` directory.
- The file must contain a top-level `main()` function.
- DO NOT call `main()` at the bottom. No `if __name__ == "__main__"` needed.
- Use `print()` for output and `input()` for interaction.
- Avoid importing unnecessary libraries.

üí° Example:
------------

    def main():
        print("Welcome to my custom tool!")
        name = input("What's your name? ")
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")

Once saved in tools/, it will automatically appear in the H7T terminal menu.
